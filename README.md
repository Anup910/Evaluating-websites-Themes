# Evaluating-websites-Themes-for-Enhanced-User-Engagement-and-Sales

# Objective:

An online bookstore aims to refine its website design to boost user engagement and increase book sales. Currently, users can choose between two visual themes: Light Theme and Dark Theme. To determine which theme performs better, the bookstoreâ€™s data science team plans to conduct an A/B test to analyze user interactions and conversion rates.

The goal is to assess whether there is a statistically significant difference in key engagement and sales metrics between the two themes.

# Data Features:

Theme Preference: Whether the user interacted with the Light Theme or Dark Theme.

Click-Through Rate (CTR): The percentage of users who engage with links or buttons.

Conversion Rate: The proportion of first-time visitors who sign up.

Bounce Rate: The percentage of users who leave after viewing a single page.

Scroll Depth: How far users scroll through web pages.

User Demographics: Includes Age and Location.

Session Duration: The total time a user spends on the site.

Purchases: Whether the user completed a book purchase.

Cart Activity: Whether books were added to the shopping cart

# Key Analysis Focus :

1)Compare user engagement levels across both themes.

2)Identify which theme leads to higher conversions and more purchases.

3)Evaluate whether differences in engagement and sales are statistically significant
